Software
--------

There are many good software codes for semidefinite programming. Among the most well-known, the following ones are presented:

*   [SeDuMi](http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/), originally by Jos Sturm, now being maintained by the optimization group at McMaster University
*   [SDPT3](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html), by Kim-Chuan Toh, Reha Tütüncü, and Mike Todd
*   [SDPA](http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/download.html), by the research group of Masakazu Kojima
*   [CSDP](http://euler.nmt.edu/~brian/csdppaper.pdf), by Brian Borchers
*   [SDP software](http://www.sdp-software.it/), by various authors

A very convenient way of using these (and other) SDP solvers under MATLAB® is through the [YALMIP Parser/Solver](https://yalmip.github.io/) by Johan Löfberg.
